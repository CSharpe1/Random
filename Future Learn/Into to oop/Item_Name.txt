Metals
####
Iron
Iron is a dull, dark-colored metal and one of the most abundant metals found all across Tamriel. It is relatively soft and malleable, but also cheap to obtain because of the low-quality armor, blades and utility tools (such as kitchenware) that it can be smithed to produce. For these reasons, it is the most common type of metal to be used in the crafting of armors.

More durable, battle-fit armor can be produced by alloying it with other metals, particularly metallic corundum. When the ratio of iron to corundum is near 1:1, it may be referred to as steel, an exceptional alloy that is more durable the more exactly even the ratio is.

####
Steel

Steel is a silvery-white metal alloy that results from melding close amounts of iron and corundum together. The more even the quantities, the stronger the resulting steel. The crafting of steel is only possible because of the magical properties of its component metals. It does not appear in nature, and the secret to smithing steel armor and blades was known to man since the Merethic Era. For this reason, it is considered mankind's counterpart to mer's traditional merish armor.

####
Moonstone

Moonstone is a chalky-white mineral, a type of feldspar that is malleable in its most magically-stable form. On its own, its is mostly of ornamental value. It is the primary component in the crafting of traditional merish armor and weapons. To make this equipment, moonstone is melded with iron, though more modern versions are crafted using varying amounts of quicksilver for increased lightness. Moonstone appeals to mer for its natural magic reserves and its aptitude to craft light armors.

####
Quicksilver
Quicksilver is a lustrous silvery-white metal with an extraordinarily low melting point. It is just barely a solid at standard temperature and pressure because of the way that magic flows through it. It isn't common knowledge that it can be alloyed with moonstone and iron to make lighter merish armor and weapons.

####
Malachite

Malachite, commonly known as glass, rare, volcanic, milky translucent green crystalline mineral. It is most abundant on Vvardenfell in Morrowind. Not only is it aesthetically appealing, but is can be used to produce armor and blades of virtually unparalleled light weight and sharpness. In the Fourth Era, the Aldmeri Dominion gained access to malachite armor and blades, and has only recently begun to field such equipment amongst their best troops.
Dwemer metal

Little is known about the Dwemer's favored metal alloy, because the secret to crafting it died out with their disappearance after the Battle of Red Mountain in the First Era. It isn't unparalleled in quality, but it is still in high-demand with blacksmiths and curio collectors alike because samples can only be obtained by delving into the dangerous ruins that the Dwemer left behind. It is easily confusable with bronze, but a perceptive metallurgist can discern the difference in the Dwemer metal's greater endurance and malleability, if not its slightly duller lustre. Still, bronze imitations are uncommon on the market.

####
Mithril

Mithril is a rare and enigmatic metal alloy of extraordinary strength that is found in nature, in western Cyrodiil and High Rock. Thousands of years of usage and metallurgical analysis haven't revealed its composition. It can be molded into a thin chain armor, no thicker than a light tunic, and still deflect the blows of most blades and blunt weapons with ease.

####
Adamantium

Adamantium is a rare, lustrous grey metal used for making strong and powerful weapons and armor. Its armor has a high potential for enchantment, and its weapons can harm magical creatures that resist normal weapons. Because of its magical qualities, it has been speculated that Adamantium is a naturally-occurring metal or metal alloy that is only stable in nature because of magic. On the other hand, it may just be a rare metal capable of channeling magical energy from inside of the Mundus.

From what has been seen of Aedric artifacts, such as the remains of the Ada-mantia, Adamantium may have been their metal of choice.

####
Ebony

Ebony is a naturally-occurring, magically-infused obsidian glass, with enough malleability for it to be crafted into armors and weapons. It is one of the strongest metals known to the mortal races, and one of the most precious substances in all of the Empire.

The life-essence of a Daedra can be bound to ebony to create a heavily magically-modified Daedric weapons and armor that deal extra damage. Dremora often wield such weapons fastened by opponents whom they defeated in battle. Because Daedra are immortal, and thus cannot be killed conventionally, this is one of the few ways to prevent a Daedra from respawning. Dremora are the easiest to produce Daedric weapons from, as any mortal blacksmith can bond a Daedra's life-essence, the heart, into ebony under any lunar phenomena.
